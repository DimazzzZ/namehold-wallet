# Node setup — reading vs. sending

This wallet is **non-custodial**: it holds your keys locally and signs on your
device. It splits how it talks to the Handshake network:

- **Reading (balance + names): no node needed.** Balances and name info are read
  from the **HNSFans explorer** (`https://e.hnsfans.com`) using your wallet's own
  addresses. You can view your wallet immediately after creating/importing it.
- **Sending (HNS sends + name covenant actions): needs a local hsd node.** Spending
  requires the wallet's unspent-coin set (UTXOs) and the ability to broadcast a
  Handshake-format transaction — and **no hosted provider offers that**. We checked:
  - HNSFans / 3xpl — read-only, no UTXOs, no broadcast.
  - Blockchair — does not support Handshake at all (no API for it).
  - HNScan — no public API. Namebase — custodial/being wound down.

  So to send, run hsd yourself (locally, or on a small VPS — the chain is light).

## Run a node for sending

```sh
hsd --index-address --index-tx --api-key=<your-key>
# mainnet node RPC: http://127.0.0.1:12037
```

- `--index-address` is **required** (the wallet scans coins by address).
- Then in the app: **Settings → Node RPC** → URL `http://127.0.0.1:12037`, API key
  `<your-key>`; click **Sync** to pull your UTXOs; **Send** is now enabled.

While the node is down you can still view balance/names (explorer); the app shows
"Start your local node to send" and disables spend actions until it's reachable.

## Regtest (for testing the full send/name flows)

See `REGTEST_TESTING.md` — run `hsd --network=regtest --index-address --index-tx
--api-key=test` (RPC on `:14037`), create a regtest wallet, mine to your receive
address, then exercise send + the covenant actions end-to-end.
